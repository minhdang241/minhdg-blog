    "# Word Embeddings Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings are dense vectors of real numbers, one for each word in the vocabulary, which is the collection of words extracted from the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to represent a word on a computer. For example, we can use ASCII code. Yet, it only tells what the word is, not its meaning. Another option is to use a one-hot vector to represent a word, in which we put the number 1 in the location of the represented word. However, using a one-hot vector has 2 main drawbacks. First of all, the vector is huge and sparse. The size of the vector is the same as the size of the vocabulary. The vector is sparse since there is only one position that has a non-zero value. Next, it treats all words independently, with no relation to each other. Technically said it does not provide any notion of *similarity* between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take an example from Pytorch documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Suppose we are building a language model. Suppose we have seen the sentences.\n",
    "* The mathematician ran to the store.\n",
    "* The physicist ran to the store.\n",
    "* The mathematician solved the open problem.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">In the training data, suppose we get the sentence never seen before:\n",
    "* The physicist solved the open problem.\n",
    "Our language model might be doing OK on this sentence. But it's better if we can use the following facts:\n",
    "1. We have seen the mathematician and physicist in the same role in the sentence. As a result, they can have a semantic relation somehow.\n",
    "2. We have seen mathematicians in the same role in this new unseen sentence as we are now seeing physicists.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">That infers the physicist is a good fit in the new unseen sentence. That's what we mean by *semantic similarity*. That relies on the assumption that: ***words appearing in similar contexts are related to each other semantically*** \n",
    "\n",
    "To encode the similarity between words we can think up some semantic attributes. We then put those attributes in the vector and give a score for each. We give high scores for shared attributes and low scores for the counterparts. We can measure the similarity between two word vectors using the dot product. As a result, similar words will have a similarity score near 1 and different words will have a similarity score near zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since thinking of the semantic attributes is hard and manually intensive, we can let them be the parameters in the network and be updated during training. One drawback of doing this way is the attribute scores are not interpretable. That is, we do not know what is attribute that a specific score represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, **word embeddings are a representation of the semantics of a word, efficiently encoding semantic information that might be relevant to the task at hand**\n",

    "# Word2Vec\n",
    "Word2Vec is one the approaches to develop a word embedding. There are two algorithms used in Word2Vec: **continuous bag-of-words** (CBOW) and **skip-gram**. CBOW aims to predict a center word from the surrounding context in terms of word vectors. Skip-gram does the opposite, and predicts the probability of context words from a center word. In this post, we will try to implement both. "

The objective is to generate the center word from context words. \n"
