Although we do enjoy the new features that Switch have over Wii:* Does not require sensor bar* Portable - able to play on-the-go with build-in console batteryThere are few limitations that we were not aware prior to purchase:* Joy Con battery not removable. (Since rechargeable batteries have limited life, customers will need to purchase new controllers every 1-2 years depending on amount of use)* Joy Con controller size are small for adults including the joystick & buttons* Gel-Con Guards need to be removed when switching to Wheel adopter* Hand Strap need to removed in order to place on charger\n",
       "10737      258240  ...  After a few months of use, without dropping them, nothing smeared on them, and just playing Smash Bros Ultimate, one of the sticks on a Joy-con is starting to wear down. I can't make it respond to sudden movements or flicking. My left stick, in particular, is now drifting. I tried calibrating the controls, and it's fine, but it did nothing to fix the issue.I looked up on means to fix this, and it requires the risk of ruining your controller further by taking it apart to replace the stick with a new one (or at least adjust the current one). Even then, it does not take long for the drifting to come back.It's entirely possible I got unlucky and received a bad pair with my Switch, but it doesn't change the fact that something like this occurred so soon for something so expensive. I really want to enjoy my games on-the-go more often than at home, but it's not going to happen the way the design is flawed.Even the Pro-Controller is having the same issue... so now I'm hesitant to buy any Nintendo-licensed controller... and it doesn't help that the warranty for these controllers are so short. Terrific. Thanks for nothing, Nintendo.>.>\n",

I for one actually really like Joy Cons, they’re a very unique controller & can work together as one or just use a single joy con as one controller, these purple & neon orange combo is extraordinary! The Purple would sometimes look more like a Hot pink (depending when light hits it) and the neon orange would look more like a summer yellow (same reason; lighting) but they actually are a great combo and if you have other types of color joy cons, you can mixed them up & create your own colorful creation!\n",

I bought these used for a custom mod, so I only needed the internals. Before taking them apart they seemed to work normally. Post mod they still work normally. It is worth noting however that the shells had scuffs & a few distinct scratches. I recommend just buying new ones if you are using them as is. If you are looking to save a few bucks on a custom controller mod & only need the internal parts then these work. It is worth noting that the sticks did not seem to have any drifting issues either.\n",

When I bought this product used, all of the buttons worked on both joycons minus the L & R button. I opened them up and saw that the button on the motherboard was not attached but next to where it should have been. Also, the left joycon joystick looks like a toddler chewed on it. I guess that’s what I get for trying to buy used joycons?\n",

       "      <td>Essa review do Switch Lite está fragmentada em duas partes, software e hardware.Começando pelo aspecto de hardware, é seguro dizer que a Nvidia fez um trabalho muito melhor do que a Nintendo: O SoC Tegra é capaz de entregar jogos antigos de PC (2013 em diante) para o handheld sem screen tearing, sem frame drops, e com uma boa duração de bateria (no máximo 3 horas, dependendo do jogo).Porém, a Nintendo me desapontou: embora os face buttons (X, Y, A B) sejam macios de apertar, a pressa da empresa em lançar logo o Switch Lite afim de aproveitar o hype que o tradicional Switch gerou culminou em sticks com qualidade duvidosa sendo implementados na versão final do produto. Uma vez que o seu stick esteja \"funcionando sozinho\", isso vai sempre te perseguir até que você resolva o problema: ou envie para um representante da Nintendo no exterior para consertar, o que pode levar até semanas, ou você resolve o problema sozinho - e é aí que você se depara com uma outra limitação imposta pela Nintendo, as tri-wing screws (parafusos de três pontas) que a empresa implementou propositalmente para evitar que seus clientes sejam capazes de fazer a manutenção do Switch Lite. Lamentável.Em termos de software: até a geração passada da Nintendo (WiiU) o senso comum ditava que a audiência da empresa sempre foram os pequenos até os adolescentes. Com o Switch, a Nintendo quer mudar essa idéia e abraçar todos os públicos. Mas os desenvolvedores ainda não engoliram essa, principalmente porque lançaram seus jogos nas plataformas anteriores da Nintendo e se arrependeram amargamente, devido às míseras vendas de seus jogos. É por isso que desenvolvedores como Rockstar, Activision, EA, dentre outros não lançam jogos considerados 'Mature' na plataforma. Depois de quase três anos de mercado, o Switch ainda vive o momento em que essas desenvolvedoras ficam esperando ver quem dá o primeiro passo. Se for feito com sucesso e a lucratividade compensar, as outras seguem. Nesse período de indecisão, a comunidade Switch ainda debate \"onde está GTA V para o Switch?\", \"Cadê o port de Red Dead Redemption?\", \"por quê ainda não temos Tomb Raider ou Deus EX no Switch?\", entre outras reivindicações. Os jogos \"first-party\" nada mais são do que ports do WiiU cujos preços são absurdamente caros. Para se ter uma idéia, Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze, um jogo do WiiU com mais de cinco anos de existência, é cobrado por 60 Dólares. Tudo bem, o jogo é bonito, porém velho demais e caro demais. E essa tem sido a filosofia da empresa, se for first-party, cobre o máximo. Diferente da competidora Sony, onde até mesmo jogos first-party como God of War é descontado mais da metade em promoções na PS Store, a Nintendo quer sempre cobrar o máximo, descontando seus jogos em 33% de vez em nunca na Nintendo eShop. Esse desconto é seletivo (não valem para todos os jogos da empresa). Além disso, falando na eShop, você sempre compra um jogo 'no escuro': sem uma demo, sem review para você ter uma idéia se o jogo é bom ou não antes de comprar. Então supomos que você compre o jogo mesmo assim. Se arrependeu? Azar o seu, a Nintendo não permite refunds (retorno do software e o seu dinheiro de volta). Um absurdo. E como as leis vigentes brasileiras são mais feitas pra te ferrar do que pra te ajudar, é melhor você procurar um vídeo de um gameplay no Youtube antes de efetuar a sua compra. Você foi avisado.Por fim, eu tenho mais de 340 horas com o meu Switch Lite. Me arrependo de ter comprado o handheld com um preço tão salgado, confesso que deveria ter esperado mais um ano, quem sabe até lá o Switch Lite teria um preço menos abusivo e jogos mais atrativos. Não sou fã de Mario e toda aquela corja \"fofinha demais e caro demais\" da Nintendo. Admitidamente, se o projeto Smach Z (Kickstarter) tivesse entregado um produto digno da espera, não teria sequer passado perto do Nintendo Switch. E tem mais: se você curte apenas jogos em 2D ou então no estilo dos da Gameloft, teu celular vai ter dar uma experiência melhor do que o Nintendo Switch Lite, supondo que você tenha um controle Bluetooth e um celular com uma configuração respeitável e com mais de 2000mAh de bateria. O único quesito que o Switch Lite ganha é que é apenas uma única configuração de hardware, portanto os desenvolvedores oferecem o suporte aos seus jogos de maneira que rodem de forma suave e compatível, coisa que não se vê muito em jogos Android em 2020.Adicionalmente, se o seu Switch Lite for teu hardware principal para jogos, ele vai ficar bastante judiado.Você vai precisar de um case, uma skin e um grip.

It's fast, works great, and didn't have any trouble setting up. I've got to admit, it was hard switching from Windows to IOS, but that was on my part. I was loving it until I really started seeing some changes...It was only, what? Two days in? I unplugged my laptop because I left my room to do assignments in my sister's room, and less than an hour later my laptop went from 100 to 89. I wasn't even using any \"THIS NEEDS POWER\" apps. I had all the energy saver settings on, and my brightness was low as well. Also, (please read the whole thing because I'm not sure if it's me or the laptop) I had problems with the temperature. It was overheating. I would always hear the fan on at times that were so unnecessary.I'll admit, high-graphic games were played, but after I stopped playing those games, the fan was still moving like someone trying to find a bathroom in Taco Bell. And, it was LOUD, like enough to wake up a 'tarantula' loud (of course not THAT loud, but it sounded like I was using a 2010 desktop Windows 7 Vista CPU). I have a laptop stand, but it has holes. Could that still factor in my circulation issues? I mean, there aren't any ventilation holes on the bottom, right? RIGHT?That's the laptop stand. It says it has heat vents, and in the picture, it shows a Macbook:https://www.amazon.com/Adjustable-Aluminum-Multi-Angle-Heat-Vent-Compatible/dp/B088DB45HG/ref=pd_ybh_a_219?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=R8VBZ111SHQCQCPPHJSX                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I am overall satisfied with the laptop.

Could that still factor in my circulation issues? I mean, there aren't any ventilation holes on the bottom, right? RIGHT?That's the laptop stand. It says it has heat vents, and in the picture, it shows a Macbook:\n",
       "4248   Essa review do Switch Lite está fragmentada em duas partes, software e hardware.Começando pelo aspecto de hardware, é seguro dizer que a Nvidia fez um trabalho muito melhor do que a Nintendo: O SoC Tegra é capaz de entregar jogos antigos de PC (2013 em diante) para o handheld sem screen tearing, sem frame drops, e com uma boa duração de bateria (no máximo 3 horas, dependendo do jogo).Porém, a Nintendo me desapontou: embora os face buttons (X, Y, A B) sejam macios de apertar, a pressa da empresa em lançar logo o Switch Lite afim de aproveitar o hype que o tradicional Switch gerou culminou em sticks com qualidade duvidosa sendo implementados na versão final do produto. Uma vez que o seu stick esteja \"funcionando sozinho\", isso vai sempre te perseguir até que você resolva o problema: ou envie para um representante da Nintendo no exterior para consertar, o que pode levar até semanas, ou você resolve o problema sozinho - e é aí que você se depara com uma outra limitação imposta pela Nintendo, as tri-wing screws (parafusos de três pontas) que a empresa implementou propositalmente para evitar que seus clientes sejam capazes de fazer a manutenção do Switch Lite. Lamentável.Em termos de software: até a geração passada da Nintendo (WiiU) o senso comum ditava que a audiência da empresa sempre foram os pequenos até os adolescentes. Com o Switch, a Nintendo quer mudar essa idéia e abraçar todos os públicos. Mas os desenvolvedores ainda não engoliram essa, principalmente porque lançaram seus jogos nas plataformas anteriores da Nintendo e se arrependeram amargamente, devido às míseras vendas de seus jogos. É por isso que desenvolvedores como Rockstar, Activision, EA, dentre outros não lançam jogos considerados 'Mature' na plataforma. Depois de quase três anos de mercado, o Switch ainda vive o momento em que essas desenvolvedoras ficam esperando ver quem dá o primeiro passo. Se for feito com sucesso e a lucratividade compensar, as outras seguem. Nesse período de indecisão, a comunidade Switch ainda debate \"onde está GTA V para o Switch?\", \"Cadê o port de Red Dead Redemption?\", \"por quê ainda não temos Tomb Raider ou Deus EX no Switch?\", entre outras reivindicações. Os jogos \"first-party\" nada mais são do que ports do WiiU cujos preços são absurdamente caros. Para se ter uma idéia, Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze, um jogo do WiiU com mais de cinco anos de existência, é cobrado por 60 Dólares. Tudo bem, o jogo é bonito, porém velho demais e caro demais. E essa tem sido a filosofia da empresa, se for first-party, cobre o máximo. Diferente da competidora Sony, onde até mesmo jogos first-party como God of War é descontado mais da metade em promoções na PS Store, a Nintendo quer sempre cobrar o máximo, descontando seus jogos em 33% de vez em nunca na Nintendo eShop. Esse desconto é seletivo (não valem para todos os jogos da empresa). Além disso, falando na eShop, você sempre compra um jogo 'no escuro': sem uma demo, sem review para você ter uma idéia se o jogo é bom ou não antes de comprar. Então supomos que você compre o jogo mesmo assim. Se arrependeu? Azar o seu, a Nintendo não permite refunds (retorno do software e o seu dinheiro de volta). Um absurdo. E como as leis vigentes brasileiras são mais feitas pra te ferrar do que pra te ajudar, é melhor você procurar um vídeo de um gameplay no Youtube antes de efetuar a sua compra. Você foi avisado.Por fim, eu tenho mais de 340 horas com o meu Switch Lite. Me arrependo de ter comprado o handheld com um preço tão salgado, confesso que deveria ter esperado mais um ano, quem sabe até lá o Switch Lite teria um preço menos abusivo e jogos mais atrativos. Não sou fã de Mario e toda aquela corja \"fofinha demais e caro demais\" da Nintendo. Admitidamente, se o projeto Smach Z (Kickstarter) tivesse entregado um produto digno da espera, não teria sequer passado perto do Nintendo Switch. E tem mais: se você curte apenas jogos em 2D ou então no estilo dos da Gameloft, teu celular vai ter dar uma experiência melhor do que o Nintendo Switch Lite, supondo que você tenha um controle Bluetooth e um celular com uma configuração respeitável e com mais de 2000mAh de bateria. O único quesito que o Switch Lite ganha é que é apenas uma única configuração de hardware, portanto os desenvolvedores oferecem o suporte aos seus jogos de maneira que rodem de forma suave e compatível, coisa que não se vê muito em jogos Android em 2020.Adicionalmente, se o seu Switch Lite for teu hardware principal para jogos, ele vai ficar bastante judiado.Você vai precisar de um case, uma skin e um grip.

I received the 2018 MacBook Air i5 quad core 256gb and the actual specs matched the description! I use it for college for my Zoom classes and the virtual background works!! I upgraded from my 2013 MacBook Air and this one is a lot faster and a much better battery life. It also came with a brand new usb-c original Apple charger for this Mac. This computer is like-new with no scratches at all and I was able to transfer all my old data to this new computer. I would recommend this computer for students and teachers too.</td>\n",

Nintendo is very aware that their older joy-con controllers are prone to this drifting problem, and thus offer free repairs or replacements well past their warranty. However, that whole repair process with Nintendo takes around 3 weeks. I don't have that time, so instead I returned these to Amazon.

I’ve had my Switch for almost 2 yrs and have logged many happy, sometimes frustrating hours on it. So last week when the Joy-Cons started gradually sticking I knew they needed replacing. The R stick wasn’t actually “physically” sticking to the right, but was sending the message to the game to move right when I wanted to stand my ground. Don’t know if any of you have ever tried fighting Ice Lizalfos on a mountain top while Link keeps trying to creep off the cliff, but I would not recommend it. I’d already searched to replace them, but due to the COVID pandemic Switch Joy-Cons are near impossible to get in regular grey here in Sacramento. EVERY store was wiped out. Even GameStop, Walmart, Best Buy and Fry’s couldn’t provide via store OR online. Amazon said they could deliver, but not until August 1st... it was the best offer I could get. So when that beautiful little brown box showed up yesterday afternoon, July 28th, while I was actually playing Zelda BOTW no less, the feelings of relief that swept over me can only be understated. And just in time too. Yesterday, only an hour or so before delivery, the L stick was starting to stick to the right also. Whew!.... Thanks again, Amazon for that little extra “sumthin’” you always seem to provide.P.S. Oh, and the controllers were delivered, packaged, and function perfectly. The actual Nintendo Joy-Con box was untampered and had safety seals in tact - something I always look for, especially with electronics (and food, of course).</td>\n",

Before anyone wants to jump down my throat saying I should've gone to Nintendo, I actually have done that more than once.

Lo &amp; behold, these Joy-Cons that were returned to me still drifted. Other than that, I've heard people say the size of these controllers aren't bothersome or small. I've also heard people say they're much too small, &amp; I certainly fall somewhere in the latter category. Holding &amp; playing my Switch in handheld is always a struggle, even for a short amount of time. I don't know if having sorta big hands was a factor but after a few months, most of my Joy-Cons also began having issues remaining securely on the side rails. This is especially true for my original Cons, they would frequently have to be clicked back into place for handheld mode. Overall I don't mind how the Joy-Cons work at all. But either I'm an incredibly unlucky sob or there is something wrong with how the control sticks are designed or manufactured.</td>\n",

Neither Amazon nor Macintosh will pay for repairs, even though I bought it only two months ago, so I'm out $700 to repair my brand new computer. I would heavily advise against buying one of these, because if 80 degree heat is enough to damage the screen, then they're essentially useless if your air conditioner goes out and you will be left with a repair bill that is half the value of the computer.

I ordered this in November and started using it in January as my main “home” laptop (minimal use). The keyboard stopped working properly in June. Some letters don’t regularly work. Sometimes - but not always- the space bar leaves two spaces instead of one. I wish I spent the money to get a NEW laptop and not refurbished. This was my first refurbished purchase, which I now see is a mistake. I live in a remote area, so fixing a keyboard may outweigh the cost savings. The battery works fine.

The right joy-con has severe drifting issue with the joystick. And there are many bite marks on both joy-cons. No doubt adding to the drifting. I did what I could to clean the base of the joystick without opening either device. But even then, major involuntary movements when using it. I have to be sure I recenter the stick after every movement to reduce drift.Might not be clear enough, but in the pictures I attached you might be able to make out the various bite marks and the damaged joystick base. Nintendo is very aware that their older joy-con controllers are prone to this drifting problem, and thus offer free repairs or replacements well past their warranty. However, that whole repair process with Nintendo takes around 3 weeks. I don't have that time, so instead I returned these to Amazon. I am hopeful that Amazon won't put these back up for sale as someone else will be disappointed :(Save yourselves the headache and invest an extra $10 for new joy-cons.

       "12415  This is not so much a product review as a compliment, so here goes...Just wanted to give the Amazon delivery service a “Thank you”. I’ve had my Switch for almost 2 yrs and have logged many happy, sometimes frustrating hours on it. So last week when the Joy-Cons started gradually sticking I knew they needed replacing. The R stick wasn’t actually “physically” sticking to the right, but was sending the message to the game to move right when I wanted to stand my ground. Don’t know if any of you have ever tried fighting Ice Lizalfos on a mountain top while Link keeps trying to creep off the cliff, but I would not recommend it. I’d already searched to replace them, but due to the COVID pandemic Switch Joy-Cons are near impossible to get in regular grey here in Sacramento. EVERY store was wiped out. Even GameStop, Walmart, Best Buy and Fry’s couldn’t provide via store OR online. Amazon said they could deliver, but not until August 1st... it was the best offer I could get. So when that beautiful little brown box showed up yesterday afternoon, July 28th, while I was actually playing Zelda BOTW no less, the feelings of relief that swept over me can only be understated. And just in time too. Yesterday, only an hour or so before delivery, the L stick was starting to stick to the right also. Whew!.... Thanks again, Amazon for that little extra “sumthin’” you always seem to provide.P.S. Oh, and the controllers were delivered, packaged, and function perfectly. The actual Nintendo Joy-Con box was untampered and had safety seals in tact - something I always look for, especially with electronics (and food, of course).

I love that they have HD rumble, an NFC reader, & pretty responsive gyro controls. I even love that they can be used as individual controllers for many games. What I don't love is the horrible drift all 6 pairs I've purchased has eventually gotten (4 different pairs purchased, a blue pair, 2 yellow pair, & the green/pink pair, plus 2 more pairs from purchasing systems). Before anyone wants to jump down my throat saying I should've gone to Nintendo, I actually have done that more than once. Nintendo did not charge me anything to send them for repairs because each time they claimed nothing was wrong with them & the very same Joy-Cons would be returned to me. Lo & behold, these Joy-Cons that were returned to me still drifted. Other than that, I've heard people say the size of these controllers aren't bothersome or small. I've also heard people say they're much too small, & I certainly fall somewhere in the latter category. Holding & playing my Switch in handheld is always a struggle, even for a short amount of time. I don't know if having sorta big hands was a factor but after a few months, most of my Joy-Cons also began having issues remaining securely on the side rails. This is especially true for my original Cons, they would frequently have to be clicked back into place for handheld mode. Overall I don't mind how the Joy-Cons work at all. But either I'm an incredibly unlucky sob or there is something wrong with how the control sticks are designed or manufactured.

Today is april 24th 2021 and let me say i am still disappointed. These worked but were the first to start drifting after about i dunno 1 month not bad but still upsetting for full price \"new\" joycons... both drift and still do till this day simply bc i have not sent them out to be fixed.1. Not new joy cons2. colors were swaped (didn’t even match what the actual box stated; (L) red (R) Blue)3. They are USEDso to start off the box of the controllers itself seemed to be slightly bent as if something heavier was placed on top. The first thing that i noticed was the colors were switched than advertised on the box (i dont mind that at all).Then i decided to check the controllers individually; both have black scratch marks as if being constantly put on and taken off of the console. With that said it already tells me they were used; now i did not pay ‘full’ price for something to be used, i initially didn’t buy them used. I could see small chips on the paint where they slide on and off of the console.Now they work, yes they seemed to work when i put them on the console; however, i haven’t actually played using them yet.I gave this 3 stars mainly for the fact that technically i didn’t get what i paid for. All in all i dont mind, as long as they work but it is upsetting to not get a good presentation.

I have had my Switch for almost 2 yrs and have logged many happy, sometimes frustrating hours on it. So last week when the Joy-Cons started gradually sticking I knew they needed replacing. The R stick was not actually “physically” sticking to the right, but was sending the message to the game to move right when I wanted to stand my ground. do not know if any of you have ever tried fighting Ice Lizalfos on a mountain top while Link keeps trying to creep off the cliff, but I would not recommend it. I would already searched to replace them, but due to the COVID pandemic Switch Joy-Cons are near impossible to get in regular grey here in Sacramento. EVERY store was wiped out. Even GameStop, Walmart, Best Buy and Fry’s could not provide via store OR online. Amazon said they could deliver, but not until August 1st... it was the best offer I could get. So when that beautiful little brown box showed up yesterday afternoon, July 28th, while I was actually playing Zelda BOTW no less, the feelings of relief that swept over me can only be understated. And just in time too. Yesterday, only an hour or so before delivery, the L stick was starting to stick to the right also. Whew!.... Thanks again, Amazon for that little extra “sumthin’” you always seem to provide.P.S. Oh, and the controllers were delivered, packaged, and function perfectly. The actual Nintendo Joy-Con box was untampered and had safety seals in tact - something I always look for, especially with electronics (and food, of course).</td>\n",

I ordered this in November and started using it in January as my main “home” laptop (minimal use). The keyboard stopped working properly in June. Some letters do not regularly work. Sometimes - but not always- the space bar leaves two spaces instead of one. I wish I spent the money to get a NEW laptop and not refurbished. This was my first refurbished purchase, which I now see is a mistake. I live in a remote area, so fixing a keyboard may outweigh the cost savings. The battery works fine.

I received the 2018 MacBook Air i5 quad core 256gb and the actual specs matched the description! I use it for college for my Zoom classes and the virtual background works!! I upgraded from my 2013 MacBook Air and this one is a lot faster and a much better battery life. It also came with a brand new usb-c original Apple charger for this Mac. This computer is like-new with no scratches at all and I was able to transfer all my old data to this new computer.

The apple emblem is cracked and the power cord that it came with has MANY scratches, bumps, and scrapes all over it so I question if the cable even charges properly. I know this is referbished, but can we please follow the policy \"external finishes like new” legit? Aside from those so far I am satisfied. Scrolling on the mouse pad is Kindof meh but maybe it is because I am not use to it yet? The keys are in fine condition and the finger print scanner works.

Inicia el juego, inicia la partida y parece que todo normal, pero después de los primeros cinco minutos de juego, dejaban de funcionar, se apagaban/desconectaban había que oprimir los botones para que la consola los reconociera nuevamente. No funcionó, los acoplé a la consola y los reconoció de inmediato, volví a sobremesa y oprimí los botones y volvieron a funcionar. Así los 4 días restantes, pensé en hacer la devolución pero finalmente terminó por dejar de pasar ese error y amarga experiencia. Los utilizo diariamente y no ha vuelto a suceder. Ahora que sú estética es excelente son realmente bonitos en color naranja y morado neón, no creo que vuelva a suceder dicho error menos con nintendo en la mira de todos pero quién sabe. Los joy con de mi consola nunca me hicieron eso de dejar de funcionar sin embargo el control izquierdo tiene problema con la palanquilla izquierda que hace que el personaje se mueva solo, lo que me hizo optar por estos atractivos joy con nuevos y chulos de bonitos, pero parece que todos los productos de nintendo switch acaban teniendo algún detallito. Después de esos días frustrantes ahora estoy muy contento con su uso.

       "12415  This is not so much a product review as a compliment, so here goes...Just wanted to give the Amazon delivery service a “Thank you”. I have had my Switch for almost 2 yrs and have logged many happy, sometimes frustrating hours on it. So last week when the Joy-Cons started gradually sticking I knew they needed replacing. The R stick was not actually “physically” sticking to the right, but was sending the message to the game to move right when I wanted to stand my ground. do not know if any of you have ever tried fighting Ice Lizalfos on a mountain top while Link keeps trying to creep off the cliff, but I would not recommend it. I would already searched to replace them, but due to the COVID pandemic Switch Joy-Cons are near impossible to get in regular grey here in Sacramento. EVERY store was wiped out. Even GameStop, Walmart, Best Buy and Fry’s could not provide via store OR online. Amazon said they could deliver, but not until August 1st... it was the best offer I could get. So when that beautiful little brown box showed up yesterday afternoon, July 28th, while I was actually playing Zelda BOTW no less, the feelings of relief that swept over me can only be understated. And just in time too. Yesterday, only an hour or so before delivery, the L stick was starting to stick to the right also. Whew!.... Thanks again, Amazon for that little extra “sumthin’” you always seem to provide.P.S. Oh, and the controllers were delivered, packaged, and function perfectly. The actual Nintendo Joy-Con box was untampered and had safety seals in tact - something I always look for, especially with electronics (and food, of course).

Today is april 24th 2021 and let me say i am still disappointed. These worked but were the first to start drifting after about i dunno 1 month not bad but still upsetting for full price \"new\" joycons... both drift and still do till this day simply bc i have not sent them out to be fixed.1. Not new joy cons2. colors were swaped (did not even match what the actual box stated; (L) red (R) Blue)3. They are USEDso to start off the box of the controllers itself seemed to be slightly bent as if something heavier was placed on top. The first thing that i noticed was the colors were switched than advertised on the box (i do not mind that at all).Then i decided to check the controllers individually; both have black scratch marks as if being constantly put on and taken off of the console. With that said it already tells me they were used; now i did not pay ‘full’ price for something to be used, i initially did not buy them used. I could see small chips on the paint where they slide on and off of the console.Now they work, yes they seemed to work when i put them on the console; however, i have not actually played using them yet.I gave this 3 stars mainly for the fact that technically i did not get what i paid for. All in all i do not mind, as long as they work but it is upsetting to not get a good presentation.

       "      <td>If you are considering buying Joy-Cons used, I would highly advise not buying them in used condition or even on Amazon at all. Because the seller listed my Joy-Cons as used and in very good condition, I figured they had been somewhat inspected for faults and I thought it was wise to save the $10. I was wrong.I thought they worked okay until about a month in when I started to notice some drift in the analog sticks. This is a rather all too common problem with Nintendo's Joy-Cons and I decided to hold off on writing my review until I could possibly remedy the situation myself. I used compressed air and a toothbrush to try and flush out any debris but to no avail. Finally, I decided to just buy replacement analog sticks to install myself as I was no longer worried about warranty. After looking at many Youtube videos, I discovered that the internals of my Joy-Con were slightly different than that of the videos online. The first picture depicts an average Joy-Con with four screws in the middle that allow someone to open it to access the analog stick. The next picture is the Joy-Con that I ordered from Goldstar tech and it does not have any screws at all. The only way to reach the analog stick is to remove the whole plastic case that holds the battery which requires me to break down many other components of the controller.Also, the other Joy-Con (Left one) has the same issue with analog drift and is now showing some signs of button failure (i.e. the controller sometimes does not register that I pushed a button). I have no way to comfortably fix the controller on my own and now I am debating between further trying to fix my controller myself which is pretty much futile at this point, begging Nintendo to fix it for a million dollars, or buying new Joy-Cons altogether.Overall, I have spent around $75 dollars in total on this product when it would have been more cost efficient to just buy them new. The reason I say not to buy them from Amazon is because of the likelihood of receiving a fake product which is likely what happened to me. It is also possible that my Joy-Cons are old but I have no idea as to why my controllers would be different from the numerous videos online.Again, please reconsider buying these used from Amazon (Goldstar Tech).</td>\n",

       "      <td>This is not so much a product review as a compliment, so here goes...Just wanted to give the Amazon delivery service a “Thank you”. I have had my Switch for almost 2 yrs and have logged many happy, sometimes frustrating hours on it. So last week when the Joy-Cons started gradually sticking I knew they needed replacing. The R stick was not actually “physically” sticking to the right, but was sending the message to the game to move right when I wanted to stand my ground. do not know if any of you have ever tried fighting Ice Lizalfos on a mountain top while Link keeps trying to creep off the cliff, but I would not recommend it. I would already searched to replace them, but due to the COVID pandemic Switch Joy-Cons are near impossible to get in regular grey here in Sacramento. EVERY store was wiped out. Even GameStop, Walmart, Best Buy and Fry’s could not provide via store OR online. Amazon said they could deliver, but not until August 1st... it was the best offer I could get. So when that beautiful little brown box showed up yesterday afternoon, July 28th, while I was actually playing Zelda BOTW no less, the feelings of relief that swept over me can only be understated. And just in time too. Yesterday, only an hour or so before delivery, the L stick was starting to stick to the right also. Whew!.... Thanks again, Amazon for that little extra “sumthin’” you always seem to provide.P.S. Oh, and the controllers were delivered, packaged, and function perfectly. The actual Nintendo Joy-Con box was untampered and had safety seals in tact - something I always look for, especially with electronics (and food, of course).</td>\n",

I even love that they can be used as individual controllers for many games. What I do not love is the horrible drift all 6 pairs I have purchased has eventually gotten (4 different pairs purchased, a blue pair, 2 yellow pair, &amp; the green/pink pair, plus 2 more pairs from purchasing systems). Before anyone wants to jump down my throat saying I should have gone to Nintendo, I actually have done that more than once. Nintendo did not charge me anything to send them for repairs because each time they claimed nothing was wrong with them &amp; the very same Joy-Cons would be returned to me. Lo &amp; behold, these Joy-Cons that were returned to me still drifted. Other than that, I have heard people say the size of these controllers are not bothersome or small. I have also heard people say they are much too small, &amp; I certainly fall somewhere in the latter category. Holding &amp; playing my Switch in handheld is always a struggle, even for a short amount of time. I do not know if having sorta big hands was a factor but after a few months, most of my Joy-Cons also began having issues remaining securely on the side rails. This is especially true for my original Cons, they would frequently have to be clicked back into place for handheld mode. Overall I do not mind how the Joy-Cons work at all. But either I am an incredibly unlucky sob or there is something wrong with how the control sticks are designed or manufactured.</td>\n",

Not new joy cons2. colors were swaped (did not even match what the actual box stated; (L) red (R) Blue)3. They are USEDso to start off the box of the controllers itself seemed to be slightly bent as if something heavier was placed on top. The first thing that i noticed was the colors were switched than advertised on the box (i do not mind that at all).Then i decided to check the controllers individually; both have black scratch marks as if being constantly put on and taken off of the console. With that said it already tells me they were used; now i did not pay ‘full’ price for something to be used, i initially did not buy them used. I could see small chips on the paint where they slide on and off of the console.Now they work, yes they seemed to work when i put them on the console; however, i have not actually played using them yet.I gave this 3 stars mainly for the fact that technically i did not get what i paid for. All in all i do not mind, as long as they work but it is upsetting to not get a good presentation.</td>\n",

This computer forces me to be productive. I used to wait around for this spinning wheel to stop, and now I can do everything so quickly that I think I almost miss the waiting part. Ha ha. I do not have time to get coffee anymore. All my apps run smoothly, including adobe illustrator and Photoshop, and they work perfectly. Almost too perfect. I really love this computer. I hope it last me for many years to come.

Neither Amazon nor Macintosh will pay for repairs, even though I bought it only two months ago, so I am out $700 to repair my brand new computer. I would heavily advise against buying one of these, because if 80 degree heat is enough to damage the screen, then they are essentially useless if your air conditioner goes out and you will be left with a repair bill that is half the value of the computer.

       "12411  If you are considering buying Joy-Cons used, I would highly advise not buying them in used condition or even on Amazon at all. Because the seller listed my Joy-Cons as used and in very good condition, I figured they had been somewhat inspected for faults and I thought it was wise to save the $10. I was wrong.I thought they worked okay until about a month in when I started to notice some drift in the analog sticks. This is a rather all too common problem with Nintendo's Joy-Cons and I decided to hold off on writing my review until I could possibly remedy the situation myself. I used compressed air and a toothbrush to try and flush out any debris but to no avail. Finally, I decided to just buy replacement analog sticks to install myself as I was no longer worried about warranty. After looking at many Youtube videos, I discovered that the internals of my Joy-Con were slightly different than that of the videos online. The first picture depicts an average Joy-Con with four screws in the middle that allow someone to open it to access the analog stick. The next picture is the Joy-Con that I ordered from Goldstar tech and it does not have any screws at all. The only way to reach the analog stick is to remove the whole plastic case that holds the battery which requires me to break down many other components of the controller.Also, the other Joy-Con (Left one) has the same issue with analog drift and is now showing some signs of button failure (i.e. the controller sometimes does not register that I pushed a button). I have no way to comfortably fix the controller on my own and now I am debating between further trying to fix my controller myself which is pretty much futile at this point, begging Nintendo to fix it for a million dollars, or buying new Joy-Cons altogether.Overall, I have spent around $75 dollars in total on this product when it would have been more cost efficient to just buy them new. The reason I say not to buy them from Amazon is because of the likelihood of receiving a fake product which is likely what happened to me. It is also possible that my Joy-Cons are old but I have no idea as to why my controllers would be different from the numerous videos online.Again, please reconsider buying these used from Amazon (Goldstar Tech).

I have had my Switch for almost 2 yrs and have logged many happy, sometimes frustrating hours on it. So last week when the Joy-Cons started gradually sticking I knew they needed replacing. The R stick was not actually “physically” sticking to the right, but was sending the message to the game to move right when I wanted to stand my ground. do not know if any of you have ever tried fighting Ice Lizalfos on a mountain top while Link keeps trying to creep off the cliff, but I would not recommend it. I would already searched to replace them, but due to the COVID pandemic Switch Joy-Cons are near impossible to get in regular grey here in Sacramento. EVERY store was wiped out. Even GameStop, Walmart, Best Buy and Fry’s could not provide via store OR online. Amazon said they could deliver, but not until August 1st... it was the best offer I could get. So when that beautiful little brown box showed up yesterday afternoon, July 28th, while I was actually playing Zelda BOTW no less, the feelings of relief that swept over me can only be understated. And just in time too. Yesterday, only an hour or so before delivery, the L stick was starting to stick to the right also. Whew!.... Thanks again, Amazon for that little extra “sumthin’” you always seem to provide.P.S. Oh, and the controllers were delivered, packaged, and function perfectly. The actual Nintendo Joy-Con box was untampered and had safety seals in tact - something I always look for, especially with electronics (and food, of course).

I am a huge Nintendo fan & Switch advocate. I love that they have HD rumble, an NFC reader, & pretty responsive gyro controls. I even love that they can be used as individual controllers for many games. What I do not love is the horrible drift all 6 pairs I have purchased has eventually gotten (4 different pairs purchased, a blue pair, 2 yellow pair, & the green/pink pair, plus 2 more pairs from purchasing systems). Before anyone wants to jump down my throat saying I should have gone to Nintendo, I actually have done that more than once. Nintendo did not charge me anything to send them for repairs because each time they claimed nothing was wrong with them & the very same Joy-Cons would be returned to me. Lo & behold, these Joy-Cons that were returned to me still drifted. Other than that, I have heard people say the size of these controllers are not bothersome or small. I have also heard people say they are much too small, & I certainly fall somewhere in the latter category. Holding & playing my Switch in handheld is always a struggle, even for a short amount of time. I do not know if having sorta big hands was a factor but after a few months, most of my Joy-Cons also began having issues remaining securely on the side rails. This is especially true for my original Cons, they would frequently have to be clicked back into place for handheld mode. Overall I do not mind how the Joy-Cons work at all. But either I am an incredibly unlucky sob or there is something wrong with how the control sticks are designed or manufactured.

Today is april 24th 2021 and let me say i am still disappointed. These worked but were the first to start drifting after about i dunno 1 month not bad but still upsetting for full price \"new\" joycons... both drift and still do till this day simply bc i have not sent them out to be fixed.1. Not new joy cons2. colors were swaped (did not even match what the actual box stated; (L) red (R) Blue)3. They are USEDso to start off the box of the controllers itself seemed to be slightly bent as if something heavier was placed on top. The first thing that i noticed was the colors were switched than advertised on the box (i do not mind that at all).Then i decided to check the controllers individually; both have black scratch marks as if being constantly put on and taken off of the console. With that said it already tells me they were used; now i did not pay ‘full’ price for something to be used, i initially did not buy them used. I could see small chips on the paint where they slide on and off of the console.Now they work, yes they seemed to work when i put them on the console; however, i have not actually played using them yet.I gave this 3 stars mainly for the fact that technically i did not get what i paid for. All in all i do not mind, as long as they work but it is upsetting to not get a good presentation.

    "\n",
    "1. Accept the label if the `rating_label`, `nlptown_bert_label` both agree on the label. I don't take in to account the `twitter-robert_label` in this situation since it is trained using tweets, not product review, which is not reliable compared to the `nlptown_bert_label`. Because of the human resource, it is not always to produce the perfect label for the dataset. Yet, the dataset sill can be improved later using Active Learning. \n",
    "2. Accept the **Neutral** label if both `nlptown_bert_label` and `twitter-robert_label` both agree on the label. The resonale for this is that when we do the sentence segmentation, some sentences from the positive/negative documents (labeled by star) have neutral sentiments, but still get labeled as positive or negative due to the rating_label.\n",
    "3. Accept sample which review has alphabet characters. This rule will remove sample text such as \"4.\", \"!\", etc."
