      <td>Essa review do Switch Lite está fragmentada em duas partes, software e hardware.Começando pelo aspecto de hardware, é seguro dizer que a Nvidia fez um trabalho muito melhor do que a Nintendo: O SoC Tegra é capaz de entregar jogos antigos de PC (2013 em diante) para o handheld sem screen tearing, sem frame drops, e com uma boa duração de bateria (no máximo 3 horas, dependendo do jogo).Porém, a Nintendo me desapontou: embora os face buttons (X, Y, A B) sejam macios de apertar, a pressa da empresa em lançar logo o Switch Lite afim de aproveitar o hype que o tradicional Switch gerou culminou em sticks com qualidade duvidosa sendo implementados na versão final do produto. Uma vez que o seu stick esteja "funcionando sozinho", isso vai sempre te perseguir até que você resolva o problema: ou envie para um representante da Nintendo no exterior para consertar, o que pode levar até semanas, ou você resolve o problema sozinho - e é aí que você se depara com uma outra limitação imposta pela Nintendo, as tri-wing screws (parafusos de três pontas) que a empresa implementou propositalmente para evitar que seus clientes sejam capazes de fazer a manutenção do Switch Lite. Lamentável.Em termos de software: até a geração passada da Nintendo (WiiU) o senso comum ditava que a audiência da empresa sempre foram os pequenos até os adolescentes. Com o Switch, a Nintendo quer mudar essa idéia e abraçar todos os públicos. Mas os desenvolvedores ainda não engoliram essa, principalmente porque lançaram seus jogos nas plataformas anteriores da Nintendo e se arrependeram amargamente, devido às míseras vendas de seus jogos. É por isso que desenvolvedores como Rockstar, Activision, EA, dentre outros não lançam jogos considerados 'Mature' na plataforma. Depois de quase três anos de mercado, o Switch ainda vive o momento em que essas desenvolvedoras ficam esperando ver quem dá o primeiro passo. Se for feito com sucesso e a lucratividade compensar, as outras seguem. Nesse período de indecisão, a comunidade Switch ainda debate "onde está GTA V para o Switch?", "Cadê o port de Red Dead Redemption?", "por quê ainda não temos Tomb Raider ou Deus EX no Switch?", entre outras reivindicações. Os jogos "first-party" nada mais são do que ports do WiiU cujos preços são absurdamente caros. Para se ter uma idéia, Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze, um jogo do WiiU com mais de cinco anos de existência, é cobrado por 60 Dólares. Tudo bem, o jogo é bonito, porém velho demais e caro demais. E essa tem sido a filosofia da empresa, se for first-party, cobre o máximo. Diferente da competidora Sony, onde até mesmo jogos first-party como God of War é descontado mais da metade em promoções na PS Store, a Nintendo quer sempre cobrar o máximo, descontando seus jogos em 33% de vez em nunca na Nintendo eShop. Esse desconto é seletivo (não valem para todos os jogos da empresa). Além disso, falando na eShop, você sempre compra um jogo 'no escuro': sem uma demo, sem review para você ter uma idéia se o jogo é bom ou não antes de comprar. Então supomos que você compre o jogo mesmo assim. Se arrependeu? Azar o seu, a Nintendo não permite refunds (retorno do software e o seu dinheiro de volta). Um absurdo. E como as leis vigentes brasileiras são mais feitas pra te ferrar do que pra te ajudar, é melhor você procurar um vídeo de um gameplay no Youtube antes de efetuar a sua compra. Você foi avisado.Por fim, eu tenho mais de 340 horas com o meu Switch Lite. Me arrependo de ter comprado o handheld com um preço tão salgado, confesso que deveria ter esperado mais um ano, quem sabe até lá o Switch Lite teria um preço menos abusivo e jogos mais atrativos. Não sou fã de Mario e toda aquela corja "fofinha demais e caro demais" da Nintendo. Admitidamente, se o projeto Smach Z (Kickstarter) tivesse entregado um produto digno da espera, não teria sequer passado perto do Nintendo Switch. E tem mais: se você curte apenas jogos em 2D ou então no estilo dos da Gameloft, teu celular vai ter dar uma experiência melhor do que o Nintendo Switch Lite, supondo que você tenha um controle Bluetooth e um celular com uma configuração respeitável e com mais de 2000mAh de bateria. O único quesito que o Switch Lite ganha é que é apenas uma única configuração de hardware, portanto os desenvolvedores oferecem o suporte aos seus jogos de maneira que rodem de forma suave e compatível, coisa que não se vê muito em jogos Android em 2020.Adicionalmente, se o seu Switch Lite for teu hardware principal para jogos, ele vai ficar bastante judiado.Você vai precisar de um case, uma skin e um grip. Eu recomendo essa solução três-em-um da Skull &amp; Co:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082B56D2H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1Um screen protector para evitar arranhões na tela:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QNRB34L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1E por fim, um cartão de memória. Dependendo se você for um colecionador, a memória interna talvez seja o suficiente. Caso contrário, um cartão de 200GB da SanDisk deve bastar para o seu primeiro ano com o Switch Lite:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073JY5T7T/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</td>
      <td>Essa review do Switch Lite está fragmentada em duas partes, software e hardware.Começando pelo aspecto de hardware, é seguro dizer que a Nvidia fez um trabalho muito melhor do que a Nintendo: O SoC Tegra é capaz de entregar jogos antigos de PC (2013 em diante) para o handheld sem screen tearing, sem frame drops, e com uma boa duração de bateria (no máximo 3 horas, dependendo do jogo).Porém, a Nintendo me desapontou: embora os face buttons (X, Y, A B) sejam macios de apertar, a pressa da empresa em lançar logo o Switch Lite afim de aproveitar o hype que o tradicional Switch gerou culminou em sticks com qualidade duvidosa sendo implementados na versão final do produto. Uma vez que o seu stick esteja "funcionando sozinho", isso vai sempre te perseguir até que você resolva o problema: ou envie para um representante da Nintendo no exterior para consertar, o que pode levar até semanas, ou você resolve o problema sozinho - e é aí que você se depara com uma outra limitação imposta pela Nintendo, as tri-wing screws (parafusos de três pontas) que a empresa implementou propositalmente para evitar que seus clientes sejam capazes de fazer a manutenção do Switch Lite. Lamentável.Em termos de software: até a geração passada da Nintendo (WiiU) o senso comum ditava que a audiência da empresa sempre foram os pequenos até os adolescentes. Com o Switch, a Nintendo quer mudar essa idéia e abraçar todos os públicos. Mas os desenvolvedores ainda não engoliram essa, principalmente porque lançaram seus jogos nas plataformas anteriores da Nintendo e se arrependeram amargamente, devido às míseras vendas de seus jogos. É por isso que desenvolvedores como Rockstar, Activision, EA, dentre outros não lançam jogos considerados 'Mature' na plataforma. Depois de quase três anos de mercado, o Switch ainda vive o momento em que essas desenvolvedoras ficam esperando ver quem dá o primeiro passo. Se for feito com sucesso e a lucratividade compensar, as outras seguem. Nesse período de indecisão, a comunidade Switch ainda debate "onde está GTA V para o Switch?", "Cadê o port de Red Dead Redemption?", "por quê ainda não temos Tomb Raider ou Deus EX no Switch?", entre outras reivindicações. Os jogos "first-party" nada mais são do que ports do WiiU cujos preços são absurdamente caros. Para se ter uma idéia, Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze, um jogo do WiiU com mais de cinco anos de existência, é cobrado por 60 Dólares. Tudo bem, o jogo é bonito, porém velho demais e caro demais. E essa tem sido a filosofia da empresa, se for first-party, cobre o máximo. Diferente da competidora Sony, onde até mesmo jogos first-party como God of War é descontado mais da metade em promoções na PS Store, a Nintendo quer sempre cobrar o máximo, descontando seus jogos em 33% de vez em nunca na Nintendo eShop. Esse desconto é seletivo (não valem para todos os jogos da empresa). Além disso, falando na eShop, você sempre compra um jogo 'no escuro': sem uma demo, sem review para você ter uma idéia se o jogo é bom ou não antes de comprar. Então supomos que você compre o jogo mesmo assim. Se arrependeu? Azar o seu, a Nintendo não permite refunds (retorno do software e o seu dinheiro de volta). Um absurdo. E como as leis vigentes brasileiras são mais feitas pra te ferrar do que pra te ajudar, é melhor você procurar um vídeo de um gameplay no Youtube antes de efetuar a sua compra. Você foi avisado.Por fim, eu tenho mais de 340 horas com o meu Switch Lite. Me arrependo de ter comprado o handheld com um preço tão salgado, confesso que deveria ter esperado mais um ano, quem sabe até lá o Switch Lite teria um preço menos abusivo e jogos mais atrativos. Não sou fã de Mario e toda aquela corja "fofinha demais e caro demais" da Nintendo. Admitidamente, se o projeto Smach Z (Kickstarter) tivesse entregado um produto digno da espera, não teria sequer passado perto do Nintendo Switch. E tem mais: se você curte apenas jogos em 2D ou então no estilo dos da Gameloft, teu celular vai ter dar uma experiência melhor do que o Nintendo Switch Lite, supondo que você tenha um controle Bluetooth e um celular com uma configuração respeitável e com mais de 2000mAh de bateria. O único quesito que o Switch Lite ganha é que é apenas uma única configuração de hardware, portanto os desenvolvedores oferecem o suporte aos seus jogos de maneira que rodem de forma suave e compatível, coisa que não se vê muito em jogos Android em 2020.Adicionalmente, se o seu Switch Lite for teu hardware principal para jogos, ele vai ficar bastante judiado.Você vai precisar de um case, uma skin e um grip. Eu recomendo essa solução três-em-um da Skull &amp; Co: screen protector para evitar arranhões na tela: por fim, um cartão de memória. Dependendo se você for um colecionador, a memória interna talvez seja o suficiente. Caso contrário, um cartão de 200GB da SanDisk deve bastar para o seu primeiro ano com o Switch Lite:</td>

Nintendo is very aware that their older joy-con controllers are prone to this drifting problem, and thus offer free repairs or replacements well past their warranty. However, that whole repair process with Nintendo takes around 3 weeks. I don't have that time, so instead I returned these to Amazon. I am hopeful that Amazon won't put these back up for sale as someone else will be disappointed :(Save yourselves the headache and invest an extra $10 for new joy-cons.</td>

      <td>This is not so much a product review as a compliment, so here goes...Just wanted to give the Amazon delivery service a “Thank you”. I’ve had my Switch for almost 2 yrs and have logged many happy, sometimes frustrating hours on it. So last week when the Joy-Cons started gradually sticking I knew they needed replacing. The R stick wasn’t actually “physically” sticking to the right, but was sending the message to the game to move right when I wanted to stand my ground. Don’t know if any of you have ever tried fighting Ice Lizalfos on a mountain top while Link keeps trying to creep off the cliff, but I would not recommend it. I’d already searched to replace them, but due to the COVID pandemic Switch Joy-Cons are near impossible to get in regular grey here in Sacramento. EVERY store was wiped out. Even GameStop, Walmart, Best Buy and Fry’s couldn’t provide via store OR online. Amazon said they could deliver, but not until August 1st... it was the best offer I could get. So when that beautiful little brown box showed up yesterday afternoon, July 28th, while I was actually playing Zelda BOTW no less, the feelings of relief that swept over me can only be understated. And just in time too. Yesterday, only an hour or so before delivery, the L stick was starting to stick to the right also. Whew!.... Thanks again, Amazon for that little extra “sumthin’” you always seem to provide.P.S. Oh, and the controllers were delivered, packaged, and function perfectly. The actual Nintendo Joy-Con box was untampered and had safety seals in tact - something I always look for, especially with electronics (and food, of course).</td>

      <td>I desperately wanted to love this product. I'm a huge Nintendo fan &amp; Switch advocate. I love that they have HD rumble, an NFC reader, &amp; pretty responsive gyro controls. I even love that they can be used as individual controllers for many games. What I don't love is the horrible drift all 6 pairs I've purchased has eventually gotten (4 different pairs purchased, a blue pair, 2 yellow pair, &amp; the green/pink pair, plus 2 more pairs from purchasing systems). Before anyone wants to jump down my throat saying I should've gone to Nintendo, I actually have done that more than once. Nintendo did not charge me anything to send them for repairs because each time they claimed nothing was wrong with them &amp; the very same Joy-Cons would be returned to me. Lo &amp; behold, these Joy-Cons that were returned to me still drifted. Other than that, I've heard people say the size of these controllers aren't bothersome or small. I've also heard people say they're much too small, &amp; I certainly fall somewhere in the latter category. Holding &amp; playing my Switch in handheld is always a struggle, even for a short amount of time. I don't know if having sorta big hands was a factor but after a few months, most of my Joy-Cons also began having issues remaining securely on the side rails. This is especially true for my original Cons, they would frequently have to be clicked back into place for handheld mode. Overall I don't mind how the Joy-Cons work at all. But either I'm an incredibly unlucky sob or there is something wrong with how the control sticks are designed or manufactured.</td>

      <td>Bought these controllers because after a year the ones that came with the switch started to malfunction. One of the analog controllers would drift making gameplay extremely hard. It would make scrolling through menus damn near impossible. I did buy the replacement parts and fixed the remote first (because that is the much cheaper option) but within two months it started happening again so I decided to bite the bullet and replace them. Wouldn’t you know the replacements came and didn’t even last two weeks with very light use! The analog broke and the controller started drifting again. I looked it up and it turns out that this is a common problem with these remotes. I’m disappointed with nintendo. You pay a lot for these systems and the accessories I expect them to last at least a few years. I will say that Amazon was fantastic and replaced them right away. The replacement should be here today. I’m curious to see how long this one lasts.</td>

I could see small chips on the paint where they slide on and off of the console.Now they work, yes they seemed to work when i put them on the console; however, i haven’t actually played using them yet.I gave this 3 stars mainly for the fact that technically i didn’t get what i paid for.

I upgraded from my 2013 MacBook Air and this one is a lot faster and a much better battery life. It also came with a brand new usb-c original Apple charger for this Mac. This computer is like-new with no scratches at all and I was able to transfer all my old data to this new computer. I would recommend this computer for students and teachers too.</td>

I could not wait for Christmas because he had the new Super Mario Party game and we were having a few people come to the house to play it.The controllers arrived just in time for our Mario Party , but my son and I played to practice the new game the day ahead. I usually am triple-thumbed when it comes to controlling the controllers but these were surprisingly easy for me to use.Note:I discovered that using a certain color controller gives that user certain controls over the game that the other users do not have. For instance, when using a particular color controller, I had the ability to click the game back to the previous screen, thus making everyone groan loudly and wait for me to click us back to the game at hand. :)~~~~</td>

      <td>Did not purchase from Amazon as third party sellers were of course raising prices due to low stock and high demand. Managed to find these MSRP.I had purchased the Neon Blue/Red Switch and wanted these because I read they were opposite the set that came with the Neon Switch. This is true. Purchasing these will give you a complete set of Blue and Red. So if you want to throw them on your Switch and have matching colors, you can now!They are a little on the expensive side compared to a typical controller from other console makers, but I get it. They are individual controllers for Multiplayer games and are pretty sophisticated. The motion sending is great, the rumble feels nice, the colors really pop! And the batteries last a very long time. You will not have to charge these often!Speaking of charging you have two options: purchase a charging dock to charge them, or have them connected to your Switch. I never found keeping the extra pairs charged because you will probably just have them attached to the console anyway. I rotate them out so they are always charged. The fact that the battery life is ~20 hrs, you will have a hard time and rarely be low on battery. Plus having more joycons means more Multiplayer fun!!</td>

      <td>I have been a Nintendo fan since the late 80's. I love their products for the most part. The Switch seems like a high water mark for innovation and functionality, with one caveat. The joy-con SUCKS!We have the blue and red joy-cons which came with the Switch. I bought the Pink &amp; Green joy-cons so we could play Mario Party (which we LOVE). Initially, we had no problems with the controllers. I was not impressed with the range, but whatever. Also, the delay while playing wirelessly is pitiable. If you are playing any game which requires timed button presses (Mario Party, Smash Bro's, Hollow Knight...) you cannot depend on accuracy, which is downright silly. Latency is not an issue for any other system's controllers.Now, I have got a blue controller which will not hold a charge, a pink controller who is "L" button does not register and my green controller's "X" button sticks. Perhaps these issues are from maltreatment. I do have three kids. But I was their age when I got my NES and I abused the heck out of those controllers and they STILL work today!I want to love the Joy-cons. they are adorable. The ability to switch between two and one controller play is a great feat in system engineering. The Switch system itself is a GREAT system. To ask $70!!! for garbage controllers which have lower range and higher latency than any other controller is a poor business practice. You are better than this Nintendo.</td>

      <td>This is not so much a product review as a compliment, so here goes...Just wanted to give the Amazon delivery service a “Thank you”. I have had my Switch for almost 2 yrs and have logged many happy, sometimes frustrating hours on it. So last week when the Joy-Cons started gradually sticking I knew they needed replacing. The R stick was not actually “physically” sticking to the right, but was sending the message to the game to move right when I wanted to stand my ground. do not know if any of you have ever tried fighting Ice Lizalfos on a mountain top while Link keeps trying to creep off the cliff, but I would not recommend it. I would already searched to replace them, but due to the COVID pandemic Switch Joy-Cons are near impossible to get in regular grey here in Sacramento. EVERY store was wiped out. Even GameStop, Walmart, Best Buy and Fry’s could not provide via store OR online. Amazon said they could deliver, but not until August 1st... it was the best offer I could get. So when that beautiful little brown box showed up yesterday afternoon, July 28th, while I was actually playing Zelda BOTW no less, the feelings of relief that swept over me can only be understated. And just in time too. Yesterday, only an hour or so before delivery, the L stick was starting to stick to the right also. Whew!.... Thanks again, Amazon for that little extra “sumthin’” you always seem to provide.P.S. Oh, and the controllers were delivered, packaged, and function perfectly. The actual Nintendo Joy-Con box was untampered and had safety seals in tact - something I always look for, especially with electronics (and food, of course).</td>

Not new joy cons2. colors were swaped (did not even match what the actual box stated; (L) red (R) Blue)3. They are USEDso to start off the box of the controllers itself seemed to be slightly bent as if something heavier was placed on top. The first thing that i noticed was the colors were switched than advertised on the box (i do not mind that at all).Then i decided to check the controllers individually; both have black scratch marks as if being constantly put on and taken off of the console. With that said it already tells me they were used; now i did not pay ‘full’ price for something to be used, i initially did not buy them used. I could see small chips on the paint where they slide on and off of the console.Now they work, yes they seemed to work when i put them on the console; however, i have not actually played using them yet.I gave this 3 stars mainly for the fact that technically i did not get what i paid for. All in all i do not mind, as long as they work but it is upsetting to not get a good presentation.</td>
